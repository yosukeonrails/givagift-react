description:'BudStraps Flex Sport is great for runners, cyclists, gym-rats or treadmill junkies who want to use their earbuds but keep them safely out of their way. The Flex Sport strap is made of a super light mesh sweat-wicking material that basically feels like nothing on your neck. It\'s great for keeping your earbuds strapped to you on a long run or ride, and it looks pretty dope. BudStraps let you pay less attention to your earbuds both when you\'re using them (no more fumbling for fallen earbuds) and when you\'re not (they hang around your neck waiting for you). We recommend getting a pair of Flex Sport BudStraps for your workouts and a pair of soft Free Flow BudStraps for casual walks and daily activities where you won\'t be sweating.',
